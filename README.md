# User Update and JWT Authentication Service

This service provides an API endpoint for updating user information specifically the `repeatTimes` and `period` fields of a user record. It also generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be used to authenticate subsequent requests by the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB database

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
```
````

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd your-repository
```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdatabase
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

5. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running and listening for requests on the specified port.

## Usage

To update a user's `repeatTimes` and `period`, send a POST request to `/update-rosi` with a JSON payload containing the user's ID and new values.

### Example Request

```json
POST /update-rosi HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "user_id": "5f76e8fa5341ae13f0aafb6b",
    "repeatTimes": 5,
    "period": "weekly"
}
```

On success, the API will respond with a message and a JWT token.

### Example Response

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "message": "User updated successfully",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni..."
}
```

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system (if available).
